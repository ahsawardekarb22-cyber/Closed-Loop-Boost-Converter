INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the demand for efficient and reliable power conversion systems has surged, driven by the growing integration of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices. Among various power conversion topologies, the boost converter stands out as a fundamental and widely used DC-DC converter that steps up a lower input voltage to a higher output voltage. Its simplicity, compact design, and high efficiency make it an essential component in numerous applications, ranging from photovoltaic systems to battery-powered devices. However, the performance of an open-loop boost converter is significantly affected by input voltage variations, load fluctuations, and component tolerances. These disturbances can lead to instability, output voltage deviations, and reduced system reliability. To address these challenges, closed-loop control mechanisms are implemented to dynamically regulate the output voltage and enhance the overall performance of the converter. This project presents the design and implementation of a closed-loop boost converter using a feedback control system to maintain a constant output voltage under varying operating conditions. A suitable control algorithm, typically Proportional-Integral (PI) or Proportional Integral-Derivative (PID), is deployed to compare the output voltage with a predefined reference and adjust the duty cycle of the switching device accordingly. The controller is implemented using Arduino UNO, enabling real-time monitoring and correction of output variations. 

HOW IT WORKS: 
The feedback circuit senses the output voltage.
A controller (Arduino/LabVIEW PID) compares it with the reference voltage.
The PWM duty cycle is adjusted to maintain the set voltage.
The boost converter steps up the voltage using inductor energy storage and high-speed switching.

APPLICATIONS:
Renewable energy systems (solar PV voltage regulation)
Battery-powered devices needing higher voltage
Power electronics research and education
